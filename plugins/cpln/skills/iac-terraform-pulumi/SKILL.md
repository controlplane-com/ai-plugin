# Infrastructure as Code — Terraform & Pulumi

> **Tool availability:** some MCP tools named here live in the `full` toolset profile — if one is not advertised on this connection, tell the user to reconnect the MCP server with `?toolsets=full` (or use the `cpln` CLI fallback). Reads work on every profile via the generic `list_resources` / `get_resource` tools; `delete_resource` is on every profile except `readonly`.

Control Plane has one Terraform provider, `controlplane-com/cpln`. The Pulumi provider (`@pulumiverse/cpln`, published by pulumiverse) is bridged from it, so coverage, semantics, and auth are identical — only the casing changes. The platform also runs a hosted terraform-exporter that converts live resources or schema-validated manifests into provider-correct HCL, reachable through MCP tools and `cpln KIND get -o tf`. The common failure is hand-writing HCL from memory: the nested block shapes are deep and version-specific, and resources that already exist get re-created instead of imported. Generate the HCL, then edit it.

## Choosing an approach

| Approach | Syntax | State | Best for |
|----------|--------|-------|----------|
| Terraform | HCL | Terraform state (use a remote backend) | plan/apply lifecycle, drift detection |
| Pulumi | TypeScript, Python, Go, C# | Pulumi Cloud or self-managed backend | the same lifecycle in a general-purpose language |
| `cpln apply` | YAML/JSON manifests | none — the API is the source of truth | GitOps and CI/CD pipelines (gitops-cicd skill) |
| K8s operator | CRDs | cluster reconcile loop | ArgoCD/Flux shops (k8s-operator skill) |

Pick one owner per resource. A resource managed by Terraform and also edited via console or `cpln apply` shows permanent drift — every `terraform apply` reverts the out-of-band change.

## Provider setup and authentication

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    cpln = { source = "controlplane-com/cpln" }
  }
}

provider "cpln" {}  # configurable entirely via env vars
```

| Provider arg / Pulumi config key | Env var | Notes |
|----------------------------------|---------|-------|
| `org` / `cpln:org` | `CPLN_ORG` | required |
| `token` / `cpln:token` | `CPLN_TOKEN` | service account token for CI/CD |
| `profile` / `cpln:profile` | `CPLN_PROFILE` | local dev: reuse a `cpln login` profile |
| `endpoint` / `cpln:endpoint` | `CPLN_ENDPOINT` | default `https://api.cpln.io` |
| `refresh_token` / `cpln:refreshToken` | `CPLN_REFRESH_TOKEN` | needed only to create an org or update org `auth_config` |

The same env vars drive the `cpln` CLI, Terraform, and Pulumi, so one CI/CD secret serves all three. Create the service account and scope it with a policy (access-control skill); pipeline wiring lives in gitops-cicd.

Pulumi packages: npm `@pulumiverse/cpln`, PyPI `pulumiverse_cpln`, Go `github.com/pulumiverse/pulumi-cpln/sdk/go/cpln`, NuGet `Pulumiverse.Cpln`.

## Coverage

24 resources, all `cpln_` prefixed: agent, audit_context, catalog_template, cloud_account, custom_location, domain, domain_route, group, gvc, helm_release, identity, ipset, location, mk8s, mk8s_kubeconfig, org, org_logging, org_tracing, policy, secret, service_account, service_account_key, volume_set, workload. Data sources: cloud_account, gvc, helm_template, image, images, location, locations, org, secret, workload. Pulumi exposes the same 24 resources in PascalCase (e.g. `CatalogTemplate`).

Per-attribute truth is the registry page for that resource — [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/controlplane-com/cpln/latest/docs) or [Pulumi Registry](https://www.pulumi.com/registry/packages/cpln) — not memory. One shape worth knowing up front: `cpln_secret` has no `type` argument; set exactly one per-type attribute (`opaque`, `dictionary`, `aws`, `tls`, ...).

## Generate HCL — don't hand-write it

The hosted terraform-exporter produces provider-correct HCL. Route by what you have:

| You have | Use |
|----------|-----|
| Existing resource(s) | `mcp__cpln__export_terraform` — a single self link, or bulk by path depth: `/org/ORG` (whole org), `/org/ORG/KIND` (all of a kind), `/org/ORG/gvc/GVC/workload` (all workloads in the GVC) |
| A known set of links | `mcp__cpln__export_terraform_batch` (full profile) — up to 100 links, merged and de-duplicated; on core, `export_terraform` with path-depth refs covers it |
| A YAML/JSON manifest | `mcp__cpln__convert_to_terraform` — dry-run validated against the API first, so the returned HCL always matches a schema-valid resource; pass `gvc` for GVC-scoped kinds (workload, identity, volumeset) |
| Nothing yet | author the manifest against `mcp__cpln__get_resource_schema`, then convert it |

Set `generateImports` on any of these to also get ready-to-run `terraform import` commands, one per resource with the IDs prefilled — run them after `terraform init` and before the first `terraform apply`, so apply updates the live resources instead of re-creating them. `includeDependencies` (export tools) pulls in referenced resources so the HCL is self-contained.

The exporter emits HCL only. For a Pulumi program, convert the exported HCL with the Pulumi CLI: `pulumi convert --from terraform --language typescript --out DIR` (also python, go, csharp, java, yaml). Conversion translates config, not state — adopt the live resources afterwards per Importing below.

The exporter covers 16 kinds: agent, auditctx, cloudaccount, domain (routes emitted as `cpln_domain_route`), group, gvc, identity, ipset, location, mk8s, org, policy, secret, serviceaccount, volumeset, workload. `mcp__cpln__list_terraform_kinds` (full profile) enumerates them; on core, just attempt the export — an unsupported kind is rejected with the supported list.

**Secrets are never exported.** The upstream exporter would embed revealed values in the HCL, so the MCP tools refuse a ref that targets secrets and refuse wholesale any bulk export that pulled secrets in. Narrow the export to exclude secrets; the user authors secret resources in their own Terraform.

## CLI fallback: -o tf

Without MCP, the same exporter is reachable through the CLI:

```bash
cpln workload get my-app --gvc GVC -o tf > workload.tf   # one resource
cpln workload get --gvc GVC -o tf > workloads.tf         # no ref: every workload in the GVC
cpln gvc get -o tf > gvcs.tf                             # every GVC in the org
```

Differences from the MCP tools: the output is bare `resource` blocks only (write the `terraform {}` and `provider "cpln" {}` blocks yourself), no `terraform import` commands, no dependency closure, and no secret guard — never run `-o tf` against a secret (it can print revealed plaintext). Multiple explicit refs in one call are not supported with `-o tf`; export per resource or use the no-ref bulk form. The sibling `-o crd` emits Kubernetes CRD YAML for the operator path (k8s-operator skill). For stateless manifests instead of HCL, use `-o yaml-slim` with `cpln apply`.

## Importing existing resources

Resources must land in state before the first apply, or apply tries to re-create them and fails on name conflicts. `generateImports` returns the exact `terraform import` commands to run — after `terraform init`, before the first apply. Hand-written, the ID is the bare name for org-scoped kinds and `GVC:NAME` for GVC-scoped ones:

```bash
terraform import cpln_gvc.prod prod-gvc
terraform import cpln_workload.api prod-gvc:api
```

Each registry page has an Import section with the exact form (composite kinds differ — a domain route imports as `DOMAIN_LINK:PORT:PREFIX`). On Terraform 1.5+ you may hand-write declarative `import {}` blocks instead; the exporter emits commands, not blocks. Pulumi uses the same IDs (`pulumi import cpln:index/workload:Workload api prod-gvc:api` — the provider is bridged), and `pulumi import --from terraform ./terraform.tfstate` adopts a whole existing Terraform state file into a Pulumi stack.

## Catalog templates

`cpln_catalog_template` (Pulumi `CatalogTemplate`) installs marketplace templates with arguments `name`, `template`, `version`, `gvc`, and `values` (a YAML string). Changing `version` or `values` upgrades the release in place. Template selection and values shapes live in the template-catalog skill.

## Verify

- After an export-and-import, `terraform plan` (or `pulumi preview`) must show zero changes — any diff means the HCL drifted from live state; reconcile before committing.
- Drift detection is the same command on a schedule: a non-empty plan means an out-of-band edit.
- After `terraform apply` on a workload, confirm health with `mcp__cpln__list_deployments` or `cpln workload get-deployments WORKLOAD --gvc GVC`.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause and fix |
|---------|---------------|
| First apply wants to create resources that already exist | The import step was skipped — run the `terraform import` commands from `generateImports` (after `terraform init`), then re-plan |
| `Kind "X" is not Terraform-convertible` | The exporter covers the 16 kinds above (image and user are not among them); manage others via `cpln apply` |
| Export refused mentioning plaintext secrets | Narrow the ref/export to exclude secrets — secret export is not supported |
| Org create or `auth_config` update fails despite a valid token | Those two operations require `CPLN_REFRESH_TOKEN` |
| Pulumi lacks a feature the Terraform provider just shipped | The bridge tracks Terraform provider releases — upgrade the `@pulumiverse/cpln` package version |

## Quick reference

### MCP tools

- `mcp__cpln__export_terraform` — HCL for existing resources by self link; bulk via path-depth refs; `generateImports`, `includeDependencies`
- `mcp__cpln__export_terraform_batch` (full profile) — several explicit links merged into one HCL set
- `mcp__cpln__convert_to_terraform` — manifest to HCL, dry-run validated first
- `mcp__cpln__list_terraform_kinds` (full profile) — exporter-supported kinds
- `mcp__cpln__get_resource_schema` — exact API schema when authoring a manifest to convert

CLI fallback: in CI/CD, `CPLN_TOKEN` + `CPLN_ORG` drive `terraform`/`pulumi` directly; `cpln KIND get -o tf` scaffolds HCL from live resources.
